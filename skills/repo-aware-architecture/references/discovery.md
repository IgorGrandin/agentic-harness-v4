# Repository-grounded discovery

Use this mode when the destination is unclear or credible alternatives remain.

## Evidence map

Inspect only what can change the decision:

- current responsibilities and boundaries;
- existing extension points and analogous flows;
- callers, consumers, data ownership, and external dependencies;
- runtime and deployment constraints;
- tests that encode intended behavior;
- active specs, ADRs, and recent decisions.

Record findings as:

- **Observed:** directly supported by code, documentation, configuration, tests, or runtime evidence.
- **Inferred:** likely but not yet verified.
- **Unknown:** material information still missing.

Ask the user about product intent, priorities, or external constraints only after repository inspection has eliminated questions the code can answer.

## Discovery output

State:

1. decision to make;
2. outcome and success measures;
3. drivers and constraints;
4. relevant current architecture;
5. credible options or the probe needed to discover them;
6. material unknowns.

Return all material unknowns and consequential ambiguity to the root in the V4 single-kernel workflow. If the problem spans several independent subsystems, decompose it and make dependencies explicit before designing the first slice.
